                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Around 9 million people die each year from starvation, which is roughly more than
                24,000 deaths every single day just from starvation. This alarming statistic reveals
                a cruel reality. Despite global food production being sufficient to feed the world,
                millions still lack access to enough nutrition. Starvation is often the result of a
                combination of poverty, conflict, political instability, and climate change. Regions
                plagued by war or economic hardship frequently face disrupted food supplies,
                making it impossible for many families to meet their basic nutritional needs.
                Additionally, unpredictable weather, droughts, and natural disasters fueled by
                climate change further reduce crop yields and worsen food insecurity in vulnerable
                areas. These interconnected factors make starvation a persistent challenge that
                demands urgent global attention.</p>
                <br>
                <p> The impact of starvation goes far beyond hunger alone. Recurring food deprivation
                weakens the immune system, especially in children, leading to higher rates of
                disease, developmental delays, and even death. Starvation also disrupts social and
                economic development. While humanitarian efforts and food aid provide critical
                relief, long-term solutions require addressing the root causes, such as improving
                food distribution systems, stabilizing political situations, and supporting
                sustainable agriculture. Without coordinated, comprehensive action, millions of
                people will continue to suffer from hunger, highlighting the urgent need for global
                commitment to ending starvation.</p>
                <br>
                <p> As we can see on the side, we have a table which shows statistics about how many malnourished people there were during these past few years. 
                    it rose by more than 200 million during 2020, mostly because of the Covid-19 Pandemic. We can infer that hunger and malnourishment do stem from
                    other complex problems.

                    <p>The Philippines is working to fight hunger by declaring a food emergency in early 2025 to lower rice prices by using stored rice and helping local farmers sell rice at lower costs.
                    The Department of Agriculture plans to grow more rice, over 20 million tons, and improve how food gets from farms to markets to help farmers and reduce food waste.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Laws like the Food 
                    Security Act focus on making food policies fair, supporting small farmers, stopping food monopolies, and getting local governments and businesses to work together to act quickly during food problems.
                    The government also has various feeding programs, one example of which is the SBFP or the School Based Feeding Program</p>

                    <p>Around the world, many efforts have been made to fight hunger and malnutrition. 
                    For example, the United Nations has launched programs like the World Food Programme, which provides food aid to millions of people in crisis areas such as war zones and regions affected by natural disasters.
                    Many countries have also focused on improving agricultural practices by supporting small farmers with better seeds, tools, and training to increase food production sustainably.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition, various organizations are working to reduce food waste, since a lot of food gets lost before it reaches people. Some governments have passed laws to improve food
                    distribution systems and make sure food reaches those who need it most, especially children and vulnerable groups. School feeding programs are common in many countries to help improve children's nutrition and learning abilities. 
                    Countries also promote nutrition education to encourage healthier eating habits.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overall, the fight against hunger is a big global challenge, but by combining aid, better farming, laws, and education, the world is slowly making progress to reduce hunger and ensure everyone has enough to eat.</p>
