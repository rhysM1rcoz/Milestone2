                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>We at Bite Against Hunger Advocacy Organization (BAHAO) are committed to
                spreading awareness about our advocacy, Food Security for all. BAHAO is
                composed of diverse individuals all around the Philippines. We have Nutritionists,
                Doctors, Nurses, and Dietitians on board with our mission. Currently, we do
                monthly outreach at communities in the Philippines where famine resides. We offer
                food supply to the community and health services such as check-ups.</p>

                <h2>How We Started</h2>
                <p>BAHAO started as a simple advocacy group for our university project at
                University of Calciumcus. After university, we decided to expand this advocacy
                group since the problem was widespread and daunting. Currently, BAHAO has 10
                core members and over 600 volunteers all over the Philippines. We hope we can
                increase those numbers. Join us now at BAHAO!</p>

            <!-- Who I Am Portion -->
            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I, Rhys Tabique, the founder of Bite Against Hunger Advocacy Organization,founded BAHAO in July 2016 while getting my Masters in University of Calciumcus.
            I graduated as the Valedictorian of our Batch. After University, I became a doctor in Africa where I saw how malnourishment / hunger killed thousands of people.
            This led me to expand my advocacy group further because I had even more inspiration to help get rid of malnourishment / hunger. I am happily married to Beauty D. Cagandahan
